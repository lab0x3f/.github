# Hey there. 🧪

Welcome to **Lab0x3F**, a quiet little corner of the internet where things are built, broken, and sometimes rebuilt better or just differently.

This isn’t a startup. Not a polished portfolio either. It's more like a sandbox filled with experiments, working ideas, and “what-if” moments. Most of them start with a question, fitting, since `0x3F` is the hex code for `?`. I build what I’m curious about. I share what might be useful. That’s really it.

> Curiosity compiles.
